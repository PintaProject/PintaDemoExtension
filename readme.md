# Pinta Demo Extension

This is a simple demo project, to be used in the future for a tutorial 
on making Pinta extensions. Currently being used as a test case for 
developing the Pinta extension infrastructure.

##Notes

- It has a lib copy of the current Pinta.Core to build against, and that 
needs manual updating.

- It builds a single dll that needs to be copied to Pinta's bin folder 
(when developing) or Pinta's install folder (installed Pinta).
